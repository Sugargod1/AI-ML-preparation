# AI-ML-preparation
I am going to study machine learning (ML) and artificial intelligence (AI), focusing on building functions and datasets to train models effectively and make them useful.
The material I am closely working with is Introduction to Machine Learning with Python by Andreas C. MÃ¼ller and Sarah Guido.
My aim is to solve the world's hardest problems using machine learning.
